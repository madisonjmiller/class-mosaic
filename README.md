# ClassMosaic 🧩  
A smart class scheduling assistant built with React

## Overview  
ClassMosaic is a web-based scheduling tool that helps students build their ideal class schedules. Users can input available courses, and ClassMosaic intelligently generates optimized weekly schedules using multiple custom-built algorithms tailored to different preferences and lifestyles.

## Features  
- 📝 **User Input System:** Add class options with days, times, and details.  
- 🧠 **Smart Scheduling Algorithms:** Select from different strategies to generate the best possible schedule.  
- ⚛️ **Built with React:** Fast, responsive, and maintainable frontend experience.  
- 🎯 **Focus on User Lifestyle:** Tailors schedules to individual productivity styles and time management needs.  

## Scheduling Algorithms  
ClassMosaic includes 5 algorithm modes, each designed for a different scheduling strategy:

- **Stacked**  
  Pack as many classes into the same day as possible to free up other days entirely.

- **Spaced**  
  Spread out classes over the week to avoid long, draining days.

- **Time of Day**  
  Schedule classes based on your personal peak productivity hours (e.g., mornings or afternoons).

- **Balanced**  
  Mix hard and easy classes across the week to reduce mental fatigue and manage energy.

- **Breaks**  
  Ensure you have at least 60-minute gaps between classes for meals, rest, or study sessions.

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React (with JSX, useState/useEffect, etc.)  
- **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind / Styled Components (depending on what you used)  
- **Logic:** Custom JavaScript scheduling algorithms  
- **Build Tool:** Create React App
